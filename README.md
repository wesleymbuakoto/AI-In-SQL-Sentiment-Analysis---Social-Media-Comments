# AI In SQL Sentiment Analysis-Social-Media-Comments
This project showcases how generative AI large language models can be implemented inside SQL using the Google Cloud Platform Bigquery. In this project, I will show how to do Natural Language Processing in SQL without having to use Python. For this project, I am using social media comments and will have the Gemini large language model analyze each comment in the database. I will do minor prompt engineering and create a one-shot prompt design for this. The model will apply Positive, Neutral, Negative, and blank if it is unknown. Then it places those results same row of the data table as the comment. Providing a much simpler way of analyzing nuanced text data in a method many businesses have access to. Also, I will set up a pipeline to Looker Studio to people the ability to look at the results of how the Model did.
